# espanso match file

# For a complete introduction, visit the official docs at: https://espanso.org/docs/

# You can use this file to define the base matches (aka snippets)
# that will be available in every application when using espanso.

# Matches are substitution rules: when you type the "trigger" string
# it gets replaced by the "replace" string.
matches:
  # Simple text replacement
  - trigger: ":espanso"
    replace: "Hi there!"

  # NOTE: espanso uses YAML to define matches, so pay attention to the indentation!

  # But matches can also be dynamic:

  # Print the current date
  - trigger: ":javaduck"
    replace: "Act as java senior developer. Your task is to write code for provided problem. Return only code without explanations"
  - trigger: ":rustduck"
    replace: "Act as rust senior developer. Your task is to write code for provided problem. Return only code without explanations"
  - trigger: ":pythonduck"
    replace: "Act as python senior developer. Your task is to write code for provided problem. Return only code without explanations"
  - trigger: ":archduck"
    replace: "Act as senior software architect. I will give you description of my problem and my current solution. Your job is to check for any potential problems and give suggestions."
  - trigger: ":promptduck"
    replace: "Act as senior prompt engineer. I will give you prompt for GPT model. Your job is to check if it can be improved for better results."
  - trigger: ":skipexp"
    replace: "Do not return any explanation only answer"
  - trigger: ":date"
    replace: "{{mydate}}"
    vars:
      - name: mydate
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%m/%d/%Y"

  # Print the output of a shell command
  - trigger: ":shell"
    replace: "{{output}}"
    vars:
      - name: output
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: "echo 'Hello from your shell'"
